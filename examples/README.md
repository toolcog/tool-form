# Tool Form Examples

This directory contains practical, insight-driven examples that demonstrate how Tool Form solves real-world challenges in AI-API integration and agent architecture.

## Overview

These examples go beyond basic API connectivity to address fundamental challenges in building reliable, scalable systems where AI can effectively interact with the digital world. Each example is self-contained, runnable code that demonstrates a specific pattern or capability.

The examples are organized into two tracks, each addressing a distinct domain:

### [Tool Examples](tools/README.md)

The Tool examples demonstrate how to connect AI to APIs through semantic templates. They address key challenges in tool integration:

- **Tools as Data** - Transform tools from bespoke code into structured data
- **Tools as Knowledge** - Enable dynamic tool discovery based on semantic understanding
- **Tools as Assets** - Create tools that evolve and improve over time

These examples progressively reveal architectural patterns that scale from single API connections to universal protocol handling and AI-driven tool optimization.

### [Agent Examples](agents/README.md)

The Agent examples demonstrate advanced AI agent architectures for solving complex real-world problems. They address key challenges in agent design:

- **The Reliability Problem** - Creating consistent, predictable agent behavior
- **The Complexity Barrier** - Scaling agent capabilities to complex domains
- **The Coordination Frontier** - Breaking through single-agent limitations

These examples explore patterns for explicit reasoning, uncertainty handling, execution monitoring, and multi-agent coordination.

## Getting Started

Each example track has its own README with specific instructions and details. Choose the track that best aligns with your current needs:

- [Tool Examples](tools/README.md) - For connecting AI to APIs and digital tools
- [Agent Examples](agents/README.md) - For building reliable, scalable agent architectures

All examples are designed to run with minimal setup using Node.js, Deno, or Bun.
