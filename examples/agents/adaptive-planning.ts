// Adaptive Planning Under Uncertainty
//
// A demonstration of how to create dynamic, evolving plans that adapt
// to new information and changing conditions using Tool Form.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// IDEA
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Core Concept:
//
// Static plans fail in dynamic environments because they cannot incorporate
// new information or respond to changing conditions. "Adaptive Planning Under
// Uncertainty" creates resilient planning by:
//
// 1. Representing plans as structured, malleable objects
// 2. Explicitly modeling assumptions and dependencies
// 3. Incorporating decision points and contingencies directly into plans
// 4. Enabling continuous refinement based on execution feedback
//
// The key insight is that plans should be living documents that evolve through
// execution, not static sequences determined entirely in advance. This provides:
//
// - Robustness to unexpected changes and new information
// - Principled incorporation of learning during execution
// - Explicit handling of assumptions that may prove incorrect
// - Graceful evolution from strategic intent to tactical execution
//
// Teaching Insights:
//
// This concept is challenging because it requires fundamentally rethinking
// what a "plan" is. Instead of a fixed sequence of steps, we need to see plans as:
//
// 1. Structured representations of intent that evolve over time
// 2. Collections of contingencies and decision criteria, not just actions
// 3. Living documents that incorporate both strategy and execution
// 4. Adaptive frameworks that learn from their own execution
//
// The key teaching points are:
//
// - The limitations of static planning in uncertain environments
// - How to structure plans to incorporate contingencies and decision points
// - Techniques for updating plans based on execution feedback
// - The relationship between planning and execution as continuous processes
//
// Narrative Connection:
//
// This builds on all previous patterns: it requires structured decisions (pattern 1),
// explicit uncertainty (pattern 2), effective decomposition (pattern 3), and
// execution monitoring (pattern 4). It represents a sophisticated integration of
// these capabilities into dynamic planning systems that can operate effectively
// in uncertain environments.
//
// Real-World Applications:
//
// - Project management with evolving requirements and constraints
// - Logistics planning in dynamic conditions
// - Strategic planning with incomplete competitive information
// - Complex coordination with distributed teams and resources
// - Research planning where discoveries affect future directions

//
// Problem Setup:
//
// We'll demonstrate using a travel planning scenario - an agent must create and
// adapt a multi-day trip itinerary while handling weather changes, transportation
// disruptions, availability constraints, and evolving user preferences.
//
// Static plans fail in this context because conditions change unpredictably.
// We'll show how Tool Form enables adaptive planning that remains effective
// despite uncertainty and change.
//
// Component Architecture:
//
// 1. Adaptive Plan Schema Template
//    - Creates structured representation of plans with explicit assumptions
//    - Models dependencies between plan components
//    - Incorporates confidence levels for different aspects of the plan
//    - Represents contingencies and decision points explicitly
//
// 2. Assumption Tracking Template
//    - Captures explicit assumptions underlying the plan
//    - Tracks confidence in each assumption
//    - Monitors for evidence that challenges assumptions
//    - Triggers plan adaptation when assumptions are invalidated
//
// 3. Decision Point Template
//    - Embeds decision criteria directly in the plan
//    - Creates structured branching based on execution conditions
//    - Enables just-in-time decision making with latest information
//    - Maintains coherence across decision branches
//
// 4. Plan Adaptation Framework
//    - Implements different types of plan modifications
//    - Preserves strategic intent during tactical changes
//    - Ensures consistency after modifications
//    - Creates traceable evolution from initial to current plan
//
// Control Flow:
//
// 1. Create initial plan with explicit assumptions and confidence levels
// 2. As execution proceeds:
//    a. Monitor assumptions against new information
//    b. When assumptions change or new information emerges:
//       i. Evaluate impact on plan components
//       ii. Trigger appropriate adaptation mechanisms
//       iii. Update plan while preserving strategic intent
//    c. At decision points:
//       i. Evaluate decision criteria with latest information
//       ii. Select appropriate path based on current conditions
//       iii. Refine subsequent plan components based on decision
// 3. Continuously refine plan based on execution experience
// 4. Capture planning insights for future improvement
//
// Key Decision Points:
//
// - How to represent confidence in different plan components
// - When to adapt the plan vs. creating an entirely new plan
// - How to balance flexibility against unnecessary churn
// - What level of detail to plan in advance vs. defer to execution time
// - How to preserve strategic intent during tactical adaptations
//
// Expected Outcomes:
//
// - Plans that remain effective despite changing conditions
// - Smooth transitions between planning and execution
// - Clear traceability from initial plans to adapted versions
// - Appropriate balance between stability and responsiveness
//
// Tool Form Enablers:
//
// Tool Form makes this pattern possible by:
//
// 1. Providing structured representation of plans as malleable objects
// 2. Enabling explicit modeling of assumptions and dependencies
// 3. Creating clean interfaces for monitoring plan validity
// 4. Facilitating principled plan modifications that preserve intent
// 5. Supporting decision points with just-in-time evaluation
//
// The key to this pattern is using Tool Form to transform plans from static
// artifacts into dynamic, structured objects that evolve with new information
// while maintaining coherence and strategic intent.
