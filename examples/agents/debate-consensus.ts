// Debate and Consensus Mechanisms
//
// A demonstration of how to create more robust agent judgments through
// structured disagreement and synthesis using Tool Form.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// IDEA
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Core Concept:
//
// Complex judgments exceed the capabilities of individual agents, even with
// sophisticated prompting. "Debate and Consensus Mechanisms" create more
// robust conclusions by:
//
// 1. Deliberately creating multiple perspectives on the same problem
// 2. Structuring productive disagreement between different viewpoints
// 3. Implementing principled synthesis of competing arguments
// 4. Enabling emergent reasoning that transcends individual agents
//
// The key insight is that structured disagreement leads to more robust
// conclusions than individual reasoning, particularly for complex judgments
// with multiple valid interpretations. This provides:
//
// - Broader exploration of solution spaces
// - More rigorous evaluation of evidence and arguments
// - Reduced vulnerability to individual reasoning failures
// - Explicit representation of trade-offs and competing values
//
// Teaching Insights:
//
// This concept is challenging because it requires embracing disagreement
// as a feature, not a bug. We need to:
//
// 1. Create structures that encourage productive disagreement
// 2. Design interfaces that enable effective critique
// 3. Implement principled mechanisms for synthesizing competing views
// 4. Balance individual agency with collective intelligence
//
// The key teaching points are:
//
// - The value of structured disagreement for complex judgments
// - How to design debate protocols that explore solution spaces effectively
// - Techniques for synthesizing multiple perspectives into coherent conclusions
// - Patterns for avoiding both groupthink and endless disagreement
//
// Narrative Connection:
//
// This continues the third phase of our progression by further breaking
// through single-agent limitations. While the previous pattern (Cross-Model)
// focused on specialized capabilities, this pattern focuses on diverse
// perspectives, showing how multiple agents with different viewpoints can
// achieve more robust reasoning than any individual agent.
//
// Real-World Applications:
//
// - Ethical reasoning requiring consideration of multiple value systems
// - Strategic planning under deep uncertainty
// - Complex risk assessment with competing priorities
// - Policy analysis with diverse stakeholder perspectives
// - Creative ideation requiring both divergent and convergent thinking
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// PLAN
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Problem Setup:
//
// We'll demonstrate using a complex policy evaluation scenario - an agent system
// must evaluate a proposed policy change, considering multiple stakeholder
// perspectives, ethical implications, evidence quality, and implementation
// challenges.
//
// Single-agent approaches struggle with such multifaceted evaluation. We'll show
// how Tool Form enables structured debate and consensus mechanisms that produce
// more nuanced, robust conclusions.
//
// Component Architecture:
//
// 1. Perspective Framework Template
//    - Defines distinct perspectives to be represented in the debate
//    - Creates structured representation of each viewpoint's assumptions and priorities
//    - Ensures comprehensive coverage of relevant considerations
//    - Prevents echo chambers through deliberate diversity
//
// 2. Debate Protocol Template
//    - Structures productive disagreement between perspectives
//    - Implements turn-taking and response mechanisms
//    - Creates focused exchanges around specific points of contention
//    - Ensures critique is constructive and evidence-based
//
// 3. Argument Evaluation Template
//    - Assesses strength of arguments from different perspectives
//    - Creates objective criteria for evaluating competing claims
//    - Tracks evidence quality and reasoning validity
//    - Identifies points of agreement and persistent disagreement
//
// 4. Consensus Synthesis Template
//    - Integrates insights from multiple perspectives
//    - Resolves contradictions through principled mechanisms
//    - Explicitly represents remaining uncertainties and trade-offs
//    - Creates coherent conclusions that respect diverse viewpoints
//
// Control Flow:
//
// 1. Frame the issue using Perspective Framework Template
// 2. Generate initial positions from diverse perspectives
// 3. Conduct structured debate:
//    a. Present arguments from each perspective
//    b. Enable targeted critiques of specific claims
//    c. Allow refinement of positions based on critique
//    d. Identify key points of agreement and disagreement
// 4. Evaluate arguments using Argument Evaluation Template
// 5. Synthesize consensus using Consensus Synthesis Template
// 6. Generate final conclusion with explicit reasoning and remaining uncertainties
//
// Key Decision Points:
//
// - What perspectives should be represented in the debate
// - How to structure productive disagreement without endless conflict
// - When to conclude debate and move to synthesis
// - How to resolve persistent disagreements in the synthesis phase
// - What level of consensus is required for different types of conclusions
//
// Expected Outcomes:
//
// - More comprehensive exploration of solution spaces
// - Explicit representation of competing values and trade-offs
// - Nuanced conclusions that respect multiple valid perspectives
// - Increased resilience against individual reasoning failures
//
// Tool Form Enablers:
//
// Tool Form makes this pattern possible by:
//
// 1. Creating structured representations of different perspectives
// 2. Enabling explicit tracking of arguments and counter-arguments
// 3. Providing schema for debate interactions and turns
// 4. Facilitating principled synthesis of competing viewpoints
// 5. Supporting traceable reasoning from diverse inputs to coherent conclusions
//
// The key to this pattern is using Tool Form to transform debate from unstructured
// disagreement into a productive mechanism for exploring solution spaces and
// synthesizing robust conclusions that transcend individual limitations.
