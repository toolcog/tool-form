// Self-Containment
//
// A demonstration of how Tool Form enables tools to become self-contained,
// portable units that combine all necessary components for execution.
//
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// IDEA
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Core Concept:
//
// Traditional tool implementations tightly couple semantic understanding,
// protocol mechanics, and execution logic in ways that limit portability.
// This leads to several problems:
//
// - Tools are bound to specific execution environments
// - Moving tools between systems requires re-implementation
// - Tool descriptions and capabilities are separated from their logic
// - System boundaries create artificial constraints on tool availability
//
// The Self-Containment pattern solves this by creating tool handles - complete,
// self-describing data structures that combine all essential components of a
// tool: interface schema, execution logic, validation rules, documentation,
// and transformation templates.
//
// Key Insight:
//
// When tools become self-contained data structures rather than scattered code
// implementations, they gain fundamental new capabilities:
//
// - Portability across system boundaries
// - Serializability for storage and transmission
// - Composability with other tools regardless of origin
// - Introspectability for discovery and documentation
// - Versioning that preserves compatibility guarantees
//
// By separating the tool's definition (what it does and how it's structured)
// from its execution environment (where and when it runs), we transform tools
// from environment-bound code to environment-agnostic assets.
//
// Teaching Insights:
//
// This pattern builds on both the Semantic Bridge and Protocol Projection by
// taking their structured approach to the logical conclusion: tools should be
// complete, self-contained units that include everything needed to:
//
// - Describe themselves to AI systems
// - Validate inputs at the semantic boundary
// - Transform semantic intent to protocol execution
// - Execute operations in appropriate environments
// - Transform results back to semantic meaning
//
// The key teaching points are:
//
// - Why code-based tool implementations limit portability
// - How self-contained tools enable cross-system compatibility
// - Why serialization creates new distribution possibilities
// - How self-description facilitates discovery and documentation
// - Why versioning becomes natural with self-contained tools
//
// Narrative Connection:
//
// This example completes the "Tools as Data" phase by fully transforming tools
// from code constructs to data assets. It serves as the foundation for the
// "Tools as Knowledge" phase by showing how tools can become portable,
// self-describing units that carry their own interface, validation, and
// execution instructions. This sets up the later examples on discovery and
// composition by showing how tools can exist independently of specific
// implementations or environments.
//
// Real-World Applications:
//
// - Tool marketplaces where tools can be shared and composed
// - Cross-application workflows that span execution environments
// - Plugin systems with portable extension mechanisms
// - Tool libraries that work across different AI systems
// - Versioned tool catalogs with compatibility guarantees
//

// PLAN
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Problem Setup:
//
// We'll demonstrate creating a fully self-contained tool that can be
// serialized, transmitted across system boundaries, and executed in different
// environments while maintaining all its capabilities. We'll show how the
// same tool definition can work across different AI systems, execution
// environments, and usage scenarios.
//
// Component Architecture:
//
// 1. Tool Handle Template
//    - Creates a complete, self-contained tool representation
//    - Combines interface schema, execution logic, and metadata
//    - Ensures all dependencies are explicitly declared
//    - Enables serialization and deserialization
//
// 2. Self-Description Components
//    - Provide rich metadata about the tool's purpose and usage
//    - Include examples, documentation, and capability descriptions
//    - Supply version information and compatibility guarantees
//    - Enable AI systems to understand when and how to use the tool
//
// 3. Portability Layer
//    - Abstracts away environment-specific execution details
//    - Handles resource allocation and access control
//    - Manages credentials and security boundaries
//    - Adapts to different runtime environments
//
// 4. Serialization/Deserialization Engine
//    - Converts tool handles to portable representations
//    - Preserves all necessary information for reconstitution
//    - Handles versioning and compatibility checking
//    - Supports different serialization formats for different contexts
//
// Control Flow:
//
// 1. Create a self-contained tool handle with all necessary components
// 2. Serialize the tool handle for transmission or storage
// 3. Transmit the serialized tool across system boundaries
// 4. Deserialize the tool in a new execution environment
// 5. Execute the tool with the same capabilities as in the original environment
// 6. Verify that all tool behaviors are preserved across the boundary
//
// Key Decision Points:
//
// - What components must be included for complete self-containment
// - How to handle environment-specific dependencies
// - What metadata enables effective tool discovery and usage
// - How to manage versioning and compatibility
// - What serialization format balances completeness and efficiency
//
// Expected Outcomes:
//
// - Tools become fully portable across system boundaries
// - Tool capabilities are preserved regardless of execution environment
// - Tools are self-documenting and self-describing
// - Tools can be composed with other tools from different origins
// - Tool marketplaces and libraries become possible
//
// Tool Form Enablers:
//
// Tool Form makes this pattern possible by:
//
// 1. Providing a unified structure for tool handles
// 2. Enabling explicit declaration of all dependencies
// 3. Supporting rich metadata for self-description
// 4. Facilitating clean serialization and deserialization
// 5. Creating environment-agnostic execution abstractions
//
// The key to this pattern is using Tool Form to combine all tool components
// into self-contained, self-describing units that can move freely between
// different execution environments while maintaining their complete
// functionality and semantic understanding.
