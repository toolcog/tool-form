//
// Core Concept:
//
// Current approaches to tool-augmented AI face a fundamental scaling problem:
//
// - Hardcoded tools limit capabilities to a predefined set
// - Including all possible tools wastes tokens and overwhelms the model
// - Tools unrelated to the current task create cognitive noise
// - As tool libraries grow, the overhead becomes unsustainable
//
// The Functional Embeddings pattern solves this by using AI embedding models
// (like OpenAI's text-embedding-3 family) to represent tool functionality in
// the same vector space as user queries, enabling dynamic tool selection based
// on semantic relevance to the specific task.
//
// Key Insight:
//
// When tool functionality is embedded in the same vector space as user prompts,
// we can use semantic similarity to dynamically select which tools to present
// to the LLM before generation begins:
//
// 1. User submits a prompt
// 2. System generates an embedding of the prompt
// 3. System performs similarity search against tool embeddings
// 4. Only the most relevant tools are selected and provided to the LLM
// 5. LLM generates a response with precisely the tools it needs
//
// This is transformative because it means the LLM only sees tools relevant
// to the current task - no matter how large the underlying tool library grows.
// Each prompt gets its own custom tool selection, automatically.
//
// Teaching Insights:
//
// This pattern marks the transition from "Tools as Data" to "Tools as Knowledge"
// by showing how tools can be selected based on their semantic meaning rather
// than through static definition. It revolutionizes how tools are provided to
// LLMs by making tool selection:
//
// - Dynamic: Different prompts get different tools
// - Semantic: Based on meaning, not keywords or categories
// - Scalable: Works with libraries of thousands or even millions of tools
// - Efficient: Only relevant tools consume context window space
// - Contextual: Adapts to the specific task at hand
//
// The key teaching points are:
//
// - Why static tool selection creates fundamental scaling limitations
// - How vector similarity enables dynamic tool selection before generation
// - Why embedding tools transforms them from static resources to dynamic knowledge
// - How this approach parallels RAG but for tool selection instead of content
// - Why this pattern is essential for scaling beyond a handful of tools
//
// Narrative Connection:
//
// This example begins the "Tools as Knowledge" phase by showing how tools
// can be dynamically discovered and selected based on semantic relevance.
// It builds on self-contained tool handles to make them discoverable through
// embedding. This sets up the foundation for Tool Augmented Generation (TAG),
// where tools are dynamically selected based on query relevance rather than
// predetermined sets.
//
// Real-World Applications:
//
// - AI assistants that scale to tens of thousands of tools
// - Enterprise systems with specialized tools across departments
// - Personal agents that access different tool sets based on context
// - Multi-tenant systems where each user has unique tool access
// - Open tool ecosystems that grow without performance degradation

// PLAN
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Problem Setup:
//
// We'll demonstrate creating a system that embeds tool functionality and uses
// these embeddings to dynamically select relevant tools before sending a prompt
// to an LLM. We'll show how this approach scales efficiently even as the tool
// library grows to hundreds or thousands of tools.
//
// Component Architecture:
//
// 1. Tool Embedding Generator
//    - Creates rich semantic representations of tool functionality
//    - Extracts capabilities, parameters, and expected outcomes
//    - Generates diverse expressions of what each tool does
//    - Converts descriptions to embeddings via embedding models
//    - Stores embeddings alongside tool handles in vector database
//
// 2. Query Embedding System
//    - Receives user prompts before LLM processing
//    - Generates embeddings that capture query intent and context
//    - Ensures embedding space alignment with tool embeddings
//    - Prepares similarity search parameters (top-k, threshold)
//
// 3. Dynamic Tool Selector
//    - Performs similarity search between query and tool embeddings
//    - Selects top-N most relevant tools for the specific prompt
//    - Filters results based on access controls and context
//    - Prepares selected tool handles for inclusion in LLM context
//    - Provides explanation of why tools were selected
//
// 4. LLM Integration Layer
//    - Incorporates selected tools into the LLM prompt context
//    - Handles tool schemas and documentation formatting
//    - Manages context window budget allocation for tools
//    - Ensures proper tool representation for the specific LLM
//
// Control Flow:
//
// 1. Process and embed all tool handles in the library
// 2. Store tool embeddings in vector database with tool handles
// 3. Receive user prompt
// 4. Generate embedding for the prompt
// 5. Perform similarity search against tool embeddings
// 6. Select top-N most relevant tools
// 7. Format selected tools for the LLM
// 8. Send prompt with dynamically selected tools to LLM
// 9. Process LLM response with tool invocations as needed
//
// Key Decision Points:
//
// - How to generate semantically rich tool descriptions for embedding
// - How many tools to select for each prompt
// - Whether to include tool selection rationale in LLM context
// - How to balance precision and recall in tool selection
// - When to update tool embeddings as tools evolve
//
// Expected Outcomes:
//
// - LLM only sees tools relevant to the current prompt
// - System scales to thousands of tools without performance degradation
// - Different prompts receive different tool selections automatically
// - Context window usage remains efficient regardless of tool library size
// - Tool selection becomes probabilistic rather than deterministic
//
// Tool Form Enablers:
//
// Tool Form makes this pattern possible by:
//
// 1. Providing structured representation of tool functionality
// 2. Enabling extraction of rich semantic descriptions
// 3. Supporting vector storage alongside tool definitions
// 4. Facilitating dynamic composition of tools at runtime
// 5. Creating consistent tool schemas for LLM interaction
//
// The key to this pattern is using Tool Form to transform tools from static
// resources into dynamically discoverable knowledge. By embedding tool
// functionality and using semantic similarity to select relevant tools at
// runtime, we enable Tool Augmented Generation (TAG) - where each prompt gets
// precisely the tools it needs, no matter how large the tool library grows.
