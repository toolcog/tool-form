// A demonstration of how to create resilient agent workflows by making execution
// observable and implementing dynamic recovery strategies using Tool Form.

//
// Core Concept:
//
// LLM agents often fail silently or catastrophically when execution doesn't
// go as expected. "Execution Monitoring and Recovery" creates resilience by:
//
// 1. Making execution state observable and structured
// 2. Detecting deviations from expected outcomes
// 3. Implementing staged recovery strategies appropriate to different failures
// 4. Enabling agents to reason about their own execution process
//
// The key insight is that execution itself should be a structured process
// that the agent can observe and reason about, not an opaque action that
// either succeeds or fails. This provides:
//
// - Early detection of execution problems
// - Graceful recovery from different types of failures
// - Adaptation to unexpected execution environments
// - Progressive refinement of actions based on feedback
//
// Teaching Insights:
//
// This concept is challenging because it requires treating execution as a
// first-class object of agent reasoning, not just an outcome. We need to:
//
// 1. Create structured representations of execution state
// 2. Design interfaces for monitoring progress and outcomes
// 3. Implement recovery strategies that address root causes, not just symptoms
// 4. Enable meta-reasoning about execution itself
//
// The key teaching points are:
//
// - The difference between blind execution and monitored execution
// - How to structure execution state for effective monitoring
// - Patterns for different types of recovery strategies
// - Techniques for progressive refinement during execution
//
// Narrative Connection:
//
// This builds directly on previous patterns by addressing resilience. Once we have
// structured decisions (pattern 1), explicit uncertainty (pattern 2), and effective
// decomposition (pattern 3), we need to ensure reliable execution of these
// sophisticated agent workflows through monitoring and recovery.
//
// Real-World Applications:
//
// - Automated workflows that must operate reliably without human supervision
// - Systems that interact with unpredictable external services
// - Long-running processes that must adapt to changing conditions
// - Mission-critical applications requiring high reliability
// - Self-healing systems in dynamic environments
//

// PLAN
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Problem Setup:
//
// We'll demonstrate using an automated data processing workflow - an agent must
// extract information from multiple sources, transform it according to specific
// rules, and load it into a target system, handling various failure modes
// gracefully.
//
// Without explicit monitoring and recovery, such workflows fail when encountering
// unexpected conditions. We'll show how Tool Form enables resilient execution
// through structured monitoring and dynamic recovery.
//
// Component Architecture:
//
// 1. Execution State Template
//    - Represents the current state of execution
//    - Tracks progress against expected milestones
//    - Captures execution metadata (timing, resources, dependencies)
//
// 2. Monitoring Framework Template
//    - Defines expected outcomes at each execution stage
//    - Implements checks to detect deviations from expectations
//    - Creates structured representations of execution anomalies
//
// 3. Recovery Strategy Template
//    - Maps different failure modes to appropriate recovery actions
//    - Implements progressive recovery approaches (retry, adapt, alternate)
//    - Provides structured reasoning about recovery options
//
// 4. Execution Reflection Template
//    - Enables agent reasoning about its own execution process
//    - Captures lessons from failures to prevent recurrence
//    - Structures adaptation of strategies based on execution history
//
// Control Flow:
//
// 1. Initialize workflow with explicit execution state
// 2. For each execution step:
//    a. Perform the operation with structured state tracking
//    b. Monitor outcomes against expected results
//    c. If deviations detected:
//       i. Classify the failure mode using Monitoring Framework
//       ii. Select recovery strategy based on failure classification
//       iii. Apply recovery actions with continued monitoring
//    d. Update execution state with results and recovery information
// 3. Upon workflow completion, reflect on execution effectiveness
// 4. Generate execution summary with performance insights
//
// Key Decision Points:
//
// - What aspects of execution to monitor at each stage
// - How to classify different types of execution failures
// - When to retry vs. adapt vs. seek alternative approaches
// - How to balance recovery attempts against overall progress
// - When to escalate failures that cannot be recovered automatically
//
// Expected Outcomes:
//
// - Reliable execution in unpredictable environments
// - Graceful handling of different failure modes
// - Clear visibility into execution progress and problems
// - Progressive improvement of workflows through execution learning
//
// Tool Form Enablers:
//
// Tool Form makes this pattern possible by:
//
// 1. Creating structured representations of execution state
// 2. Enabling explicit monitoring criteria at each execution stage
// 3. Providing schema for different failure modes and recovery strategies
// 4. Maintaining context through the execution and recovery process
// 5. Facilitating meta-reasoning about execution itself
//
// The key to this pattern is using Tool Form to transform execution from an
// opaque action into a structured, observable process that agents can reason
// about and adapt dynamically.
