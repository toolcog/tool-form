// specialized models with complementary capabilities using Tool Form.

// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Core Concept:
//
// No single model excels at all cognitive tasks required for complex problem-solving.
// "Cross-Model Cognitive Architecture" creates more capable systems by:
//
// 1. Identifying specialized capabilities needed for different cognitive functions
// 2. Matching specialized models to appropriate cognitive tasks
// 3. Creating clean interfaces between models with different strengths
// 4. Enabling seamless coordination across model boundaries
//
// The key insight is that models should be composed based on their cognitive
// specializations, creating architectures that leverage the unique strengths
// of each component. This provides:
//
// - Superior performance through specialized cognitive processing
// - Architectural flexibility to incorporate new model capabilities
// - Ability to overcome limitations of any single model
// - Emergent capabilities through model composition
//
// Teaching Insights:
//
// This concept is challenging because it requires thinking about AI systems
// as cognitive architectures rather than individual models. We need to:
//
// 1. Identify the distinct cognitive functions required for complex tasks
// 2. Understand the comparative strengths of different model architectures
// 3. Design hygienic interfaces between models with different representations
// 4. Create orchestration mechanisms that maintain coherent reasoning
//
// The key teaching points are:
//
// - The limitations of monolithic approaches to complex cognitive tasks
// - How to map cognitive functions to specialized model capabilities
// - Techniques for clean integration across model boundaries
// - Patterns for orchestrating distributed cognitive processing
//
// Narrative Connection:
//
// This begins the third phase of our progression by breaking through single-model
// limitations. While previous patterns focused on making individual agents more
// reliable and capable, this pattern shows how to create architectures that
// transcend the limitations of any single model through specialization and composition.
//
// Real-World Applications:
//
// - Research systems requiring both broad knowledge and deep reasoning
// - Creative tasks combining divergent and convergent thinking
// - Multi-modal applications (text, code, image, audio) requiring specialized processing
// - Problem-solving that combines different types of reasoning (logical, analogical, etc.)
// - Applications requiring both strategic and tactical intelligence

// PLAN
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Problem Setup:
//
// We'll demonstrate using a complex research and synthesis task - an agent system
// must research a technical topic, generate code based on the research, explain
// the implementation, and create visualizations to aid understanding.
//
// No single model excels at all these tasks. We'll show how Tool Form enables
// the composition of specialized models into a cognitive architecture that
// leverages each model's strengths.
//
// Component Architecture:
//
// 1. Cognitive Function Mapping Template
//    - Identifies distinct cognitive functions needed for the task
//    - Maps functions to specialized model capabilities
//    - Creates execution strategy based on cognitive requirements
//    - Defines information flow between cognitive components
//
// 2. Model Interface Templates
//    - Define hygienic boundaries between different models
//    - Structure information to match each model's strengths
//    - Handle format and representation differences
//    - Create consistent context across model boundaries
//
// 3. Orchestration Framework Template
//    - Coordinates execution across specialized models
//    - Manages dependencies between cognitive functions
//    - Handles state transitions between different processors
//    - Maintains coherence across the cognitive workflow
//
// 4. Integration and Synthesis Template
//    - Combines outputs from different specialized models
//    - Resolves inconsistencies across model boundaries
//    - Creates unified perspective from distributed processing
//    - Generates coherent final outputs
//
// Control Flow:
//
// 1. Analyze task requirements using Cognitive Function Mapping
// 2. For each cognitive function:
//    a. Select specialized model with appropriate capabilities
//    b. Structure inputs using Model Interface Template
//    c. Execute specialized processing
//    d. Transform outputs for downstream consumption
// 3. As cognitive functions complete:
//    a. Integrate results using Integration and Synthesis Template
//    b. Validate consistency across model boundaries
//    c. Resolve conflicts through orchestrated reconciliation
// 4. Generate final outputs that leverage all specialized capabilities
//
// Key Decision Points:
//
// - How to identify and map cognitive specializations
// - When to use specialized models vs. general-purpose models
// - How to structure information for different model architectures
// - How to maintain coherence across model boundaries
// - How to resolve conflicts between different specialized perspectives
//
// Expected Outcomes:
//
// - Superior performance through specialized processing
// - Ability to handle tasks requiring multiple cognitive capabilities
// - Seamless integration across model boundaries
// - Emergent capabilities not present in any individual model
//
// Tool Form Enablers:
//
// Tool Form makes this pattern possible by:
//
// 1. Creating structured interfaces between different model architectures
// 2. Enabling precise transformation of information between models
// 3. Providing schema validation at model boundaries
// 4. Facilitating state management across distributed processing
// 5. Supporting orchestration of complex cognitive workflows
//
// The key to this pattern is using Tool Form to create hygienic boundaries
// between specialized models, enabling them to work together as a unified
// cognitive architecture while leveraging their individual strengths.
